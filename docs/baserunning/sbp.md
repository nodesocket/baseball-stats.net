# Stolen Base Percentage <small>(SB%)</small>

<h3>$$ SB\%=\frac{STOLEN\ BASES}{(STOLEN\ BASES + CAUGHT\ STEALING)} $$</h3>

**The number of steals for a player divided by total number of attempts.**

As a general rule of thumb, a baserunner with an SB% of 75 or higher is typically productive and helping his team by attempting to steal.
