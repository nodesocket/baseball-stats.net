# Slugging Percentage <small>(SLG)</small>

<h3>$$ {\displaystyle \mathrm {SLG} ={\frac {({\mathit {1B}})+(2\times {\mathit {2B}})+(3\times {\mathit {3B}})+(4\times {\mathit {HR}})}{AT\ BATS}}} $$</h3>

**Total bases divided by at bats, using the formula where 1B, 2B, 3B, and HR are the number of singles, doubles, triples, and home runs.** Slugging percentage (SLG) is a measure of batting productivity of a hitter. 

Unlike [batting average (AVG)](/hitting/avg/), slugging percentage gives more weight to extra-base hits such as doubles and home runs, relative to singles. Walks are specifically excluded as a plate appearance that ends in a walk is not counted as an at bat.

The name is a misnomer, as the statistic is not a percentage but a scale of measure whose computed value is a rational number in the interval `[0, 4]`. A slugging percentage is always expressed as a decimal to three decimal places, and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1,000 *(a slugging percentage of .589 is spoken as "five eighty nine")*. The maximum possible slugging percentage is 4.000.
