# Batting Average (AVG)

<h3>$$ AVG=\frac{HITS}{AT\ BATS} $$</h3>

**Number of hits divided by at bats**. It is usually reported to three decimal places and read without the decimal: A player with a batting average of .300 is "batting three-hundred".

For non-pitchers, a batting average below .230 is often considered poor, and one below .200 is usually unacceptable. This latter level is sometimes referred to as "The Mendoza Line", named for Mario Mendoza *(a lifetime .215 hitter)*, a stellar defensive shortstop whose defensive capabilities just barely made up for his offensive shortcomings. The league batting average in Major League Baseball for 2016 was .255.
