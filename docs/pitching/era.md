# Earned Run Average <small>(ERA)</small>

<h3>$$ {\mathrm  {ERA}}=9\times {\frac  {{\mathrm  {Earned~Runs~Allowed}}}{{\mathrm  {Innings~Pitched}}}} $$</h3>

**Number of earned runs allowed divided by the number of innings pitched, multiplied by nine.** ERA is the most commonly accepted statistical tool for evaluating pitchers.

ERA is the mean of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched *(i.e. the traditional length of a game)*. Runs resulting from defensive errors *(including pitchers' defensive errors)* are recorded as unearned runs and omitted from ERA calculations. If a pitcher exits a game with runners on base, any earned runs scored by those runners will count against him.
